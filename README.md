==================

Server side wrapper for implementing the Shopify Api in Meteor

### Description

This a very simple implementation for using the Shopify Api in Meteor. 
Currently, it only includes fetching of customers and orders. When I
add new functionality in my project, I will update the repo here.

Pull requests are welcome if you want to extend the API implementation
or provide test coverage.

### Usage

1. Drop this file in `/server` folder
2. Edit the `apiKey` and `secret` variables
3. See example.js for implementation instructions
